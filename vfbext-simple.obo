name: has hemidriver
def: "A relationship between an interesctional expression pattern and one of the hemidrivers that contributes to driving its expression.  For example, the split-GAL4 system drives expression using transgenes encoding a pair of interacting proteins, one with a GAL4 DNA binding domain and one with an transcription activation domain.  In cells that co-express these two transgenes, interaction between the two proteins reconsitutes a transcription factor, driving expression from transgenes under the control o f UAS enhancer/promoter elements."
